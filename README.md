# VisualXploder
Two bodge scripts that allow the user to easily create sample inserts from a Visual Paradigm .ddl file. It was only (briefly) tested with Oracle SQL, and likely won't work with other systems without a few modifications.

## How does it work?
This software is divided into two scripts: `createExcel.py` and `createInserts.py`.

NOTE: Python 3.x needs to be installed to run the program. This script was developped using Python 3.8

1. Place a file named `tables.ddl` in the same folder of both scripts. This file corresponds to the one generated by Visual Paradigm.
2. Run the script `createExcel.py` or `createExcel.bat` on Windows.
3. The file `inserts.xlsx` will be created.
4. Edit the tables and save the file.
5. Run the script `createInserts.py` or `createInserts.bat` on Windows.
6. Annnddd... it's done. Hopefully, it didn't crash 😀
